In the late 19th century, cities across the world began to undergo rapid transformation. The invention of electricity played a significant role in this change. Streetlights began to illuminate urban areas, making cities safer and more accessible at night. Electric trams and trains revolutionized public transport, allowing people to travel greater distances for work and leisure. This period also saw the rise of tall buildings, as steel structures enabled architects to design the first skyscrapers.

However, urbanization came with challenges. Cities became densely populated, leading to overcrowded housing and unsanitary living conditions in many areas. Public health became a major concern, with outbreaks of diseases like cholera and tuberculosis becoming common. Governments responded by improving sanitation systems, building better roads, and creating public parks to improve air quality and provide residents with recreational spaces.

These changes laid the foundation for the modern cities we know today, where infrastructure, public services, and technology continue to evolve to meet the needs of growing populations.
