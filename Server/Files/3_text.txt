The Olympic Games originated in ancient Greece around 776 BC. Held in Olympia, these early games were part of a religious festival in honor of Zeus, the king of the gods. Athletes from various city-states competed in events such as running, wrestling, and chariot racing. Victors were celebrated and awarded olive wreaths as symbols of their achievement.

The ancient games continued for nearly 12 centuries, until they were banned in AD 393 by the Roman Emperor Theodosius I, who viewed them as a pagan ritual. The modern Olympic Games, inspired by their ancient counterpart, were revived in 1896 in Athens. Today, the Olympics are a global event, bringing together athletes from around the world to compete in a wide range of sports.

While the modern games have evolved significantly, they still reflect the ancient Greek ideals of athleticism, competition, and international unity. The Olympic torch, for example, is a symbol that links the modern games to their ancient roots.
